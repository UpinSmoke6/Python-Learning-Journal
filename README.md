# Python Learning Journal

This repository is a collection of small Python projects and practice exercises I wrote while learning the language.

The focus is on **clean, readable code** and on showing my progress from basic syntax to small, complete programs.

## Highlights

### Projects (`/projects`)

A few representative mini-projects:

- **Number Guesser** – Console guessing game demonstrating input/output, loops, and basic error handling.
- **[Project 2 Name]** – Short description (e.g., text analyzer, simple calculator, file processor).
- **[Project 3 Name]** – Short description.

Each project lives in its own folder with a short README and a single entry-point script.

### Exercises (`/exercises`)

These are practice files and chapter exercises from early Python learning:

- `chapters_1_3/` – Variables, conditionals, loops, basic functions.
- `chapters_4_6/` – Collections, file I/O, and slightly larger scripts.

I keep these here as a record of my learning progression.

## Tech & Practices

- Python 3
- Functions and type hints where appropriate
- Simple unit tests using `pytest` for core logic
- Emphasis on readability over clever one-liners

## How to run

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UpinSmoke6/Python-Learning-Journal.git
cd Python-Learning-Journal
